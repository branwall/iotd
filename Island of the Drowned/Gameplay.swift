 14 players (5 pirates, 5 explorers, 2 disguised pirates, 2 disguised explorers)
 
 7 missions
 1 - 3 players (gather food) (living members: 14) (max class dead 0)
 2 - 3 players (Gather wood) (living members: 13-14) (max class dead 1)
 3 - 6 players (Fashion tools) (living members: 12-14)(max class dead 2)
 4 - 3 players each class (Create mast / Create Hull) (living members: 11-14) (max class dead 3)
 5 - 3 players (devise government) (living members: 9-14) (max class dead 4)
 6 - 2 players each class (sand wood) (living members: 9-14) (max class dead 4)
 7 - 4 players (join parts) (living members: 7-14) (max class dead 5)
 
 Remaining 6-14 players.
 Then, the boat is filled. Dictactor/Elected leader cannot get on the boat.
 4 spots filled by decided means of election, the last spot (stowaway) is filled by (fate, if not chosen//democracy, if fate chosen)
 
 if two drowned are on the ship, it capsizes. Therefore, drowned's goal is to gain trust by not killing, but kill when strategic. Drowned also win if they compromise 3 missions (4?)
